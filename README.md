# GGDR
This repository includes the implementation for Gradient-Guided Diffusion-Based Extremely Compressed Background Restoration for Video Coding for Machines (submitted)

### Experimental results
We show the restoration results of our preliminary work (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648159) compared with the proposed algorithm.
